# hello-world
My first repository

This is my first repository on GitHub. I'm still trying to figure this platform out, but I'm excited to start learning something new.

My objective is to learn data science and database management. Hopefully the tools and skills that I am learning will provide me with a solid foundation and help further my career.

My first project is to learn the basics of the Python programming language.
